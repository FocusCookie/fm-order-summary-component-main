## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - TailwindCSS

### What I learned

How to setup tailwind via npm and have postcss installed to process the tailwind css and my own styles into one css file. Also in order to not build the css and refresh the browser each time after a change in the css, I setup nodemon to watch the styles.css and the tailwind.config.js. If a change is detected the build process is triggered automatically.

### Useful resources

- [Setup Tailwind, Postcss and autofixer](https://codingthesmartway.com/tailwind-css-for-absolute-beginners/) - A very straight forward tutorial, you can play it with 2x speed :)
- Stackoverflow - After a little bit of research I figured put which start script command I need - "nodemon --watch css --ext css --watch tailwind.config.js --exec 'npm run build'"
